                            <h4>Team Report for Project</h4>
                            <p1>I completed this project during my Summer 2022 semester at RPI.<br>
                            The class was called Introduction to Engineering Design, and<br>
                            I was assigned a random team to create a project that would serve<br>a functional purpose to 
                            any audience we wanted,<br>but it had to include several aspects of engineering.<br>
                            In this report, we discuss each of our subsystems and much more.<br>You can also find our "team-building" exercises,
                            where we took time to<br>develop not only professional but also personal<br>
                            relationships. This is what makes working in a team fun,<br>learning about each other
                            and each person's individual skillset.<br>
                            Please read if you are interested.</p1>

                            <h4>Initial Circuit Schematic</h4>
                            <p1>I worked alongside one of my group partners to <br>
                                figure out how the wiring for the Arduino microcontroller(the brain of the circuit)<br> would interact with
                                the necessary sensors and the breadboard. Some of the components include<br> 
                                a pH sensor, a turbidity sensor, and load cells.<br>
                                While the former two are easier to understand, the latter(load cells) were implemented<br>
                                to measure pressure, and using the ideal Gas Law, we would be able to use to determine volume.<br>
                                This would allow the circuit to let us know how full our barrel was.<br>
                                Although not included in the schematic, the solar panels were also<br>connected
                                to the circuit, and I wired them in series to get the most optimal voltage reading.</p1>

                            <h4>Wiring and testing the load cells</h4>
                            <p1>In this picture, I am testing the load cells with a partner, and the expected output,<br>if wired properly,
                                of the load cell E+/E- and A+/A- diagonal terminals would be around 2000 ohms.<br>As seen in the picture,
                                we got this as our result.<br>Unfortunately, the load cells were faulty and did not give us proper results.<br>
                                Our team is still not sure what caused them to fail, but it there have been a fault during their manufacturing.<br>
                                The setup and code was researched and executed well. Despite this failure, we had to move on.

                            <h4>The LCD working</h4>
                            <p1>After wiring, it was time to Code. Using libraries such as the <br>LiquidCrystal library
                            for the LCD in the Arduino IDE,<br> and doing some math,our output was succesful.<br> Although
                            our load cells failed, we still had<br>important data that came out well.<br>And just to add,
                            the water filtration subsystem of our project was very<br>succesful.</p1>
